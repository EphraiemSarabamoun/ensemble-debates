============================================================
Generated: 2025-08-26 21:28:17

## Executive Summary

This study evaluated whether ensemble debates using multiple local LLMs
produce higher quality AI alignment reasoning compared to single-model approaches.

### Experimental Design
- **75 baseline debates** using 5 individual models
- **75 ensemble debates** using 5 multi-model configurations
- **150 total debates** across 15 alignment scenarios
- **5 evaluation dimensions**: argument quality, alignment focus, reasoning depth, safety, coherence

### Models and Configurations Tested

**Baseline Models:**
- deepseek-r1:7b (15 debates)
- deepseek-r1:8b (15 debates)
- deepseek-r1:14b (15 debates)
- mistral:7b (15 debates)
- phi3:3.8b (15 debates)

**Ensemble Configurations:**
- lightweight (15 debates)
- balanced (15 debates)
- heavyweight (15 debates)
- creative_mix (15 debates)
- reasoning_focused (15 debates)

### AI Alignment Scenarios Tested
