## Executive Summary

This study tested whether ensemble debates using local open-source LLMs
produce higher quality AI alignment reasoning compared to single-model approaches.

**Key Results:**
- **150 debates conducted** across 15 alignment scenarios
- **75 baseline** (single model) vs **75 ensemble** (multi-model) debates
- **5 quality dimensions** evaluated using LLM-based assessment
- **0.35 point improvement** (+11.1%) in overall quality
- **Ensembles outperform single models** across multiple dimensions
